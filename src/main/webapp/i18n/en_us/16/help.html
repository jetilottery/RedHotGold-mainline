	<p>The object of <strong>Red Hot Gold</strong> is to connect symbols on the grid to form a lit trail from left to right.</p>
	<p>Select 6 of the 9 Question Mark (?) tiles to reveal symbols, Purple Bonus light, or Green Multiplier lights. Not all selected tiles reveal lights.</p>
	<p>Symbols on the game grid that correspond to the revealed symbol will light up. Starting from the far left of the grid, adjacent lit symbols become connected to each other.</p>
	<p>Connect an entire trail of symbols from left to right to win the highlighted prize. Trails may connect via double-tall symbols. Up to two prizes may be won per game.</p>
	<p>Reveal a Purple Light to enter the Bonus Picker. Select from the 8 Pressure Dials to collect up to 6 corresponding prizes. All prize values revealed are added to the total win. Reveal a COLLECT symbol to end the bonus and collect the total of the revealed prize amounts.</p>
	<p>Reveal 3 Green Lights to trigger the Multiplier Bonus. Press START to reveal a multiplier value of 2x-5x. The bonus multiplier revealed multiplies the total combined win.</p>
	<p>Any awarded bonus games trigger after all 6 Question Mark (?) tile picks have been selected.</p>
